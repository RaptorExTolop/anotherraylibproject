# anotherraylibproject
I am just doing another raylib project, I've taken a little break so I'm just getting back into it a bit.

Version Dev 0.0.0:
    Set up the project, imported raylib and set up github
    set up sprite struct
    set up the backgrounds
    started to make the player struct

Version Dev 0.0.1:
    Set up some player movement, thats it

TODO:
    Complete the player struct
    Set up collisions
